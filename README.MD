# Mods for Crusader Kings III
I made some of theses, and others I just downloaded and use. Details below:

### FixDomesticAffairs
Made by [Arumba07](https://www.twitch.tv/arumba07)\
The Domestic Affairs Action didn't work, now it does.

### FixHorseEvent
Made by [Arumba07](https://www.twitch.tv/arumba07)
The martial lifestyle events chain for the warhorse was broken. Now it works.\ 
NOTE: I copied these manually from memory and watching parts of the VOD, so it's basically the same mod, but some differences might be present.

### FixUniversitiesMod
Made by [Arumba07](https://www.twitch.tv/arumba07)\
Fixes something that was broken with universities.

### MuchosLocalization
This was the first mod I made for CK3 because it is easy and fun. :P\
The changes in this range from simple word replacements, to re-writes of sentences and phrases. I'm not gonna list every last changes but below is a list of the main changes.

* Men-at-Arms -> Men-with-arms
* Giant -> Biggly (including rephrasing of descriptions and other texts to make sense)
* Dwarf -> Dors (including rephrasing of descriptions and other texts to make sense. Also [DF referances](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/))
* Incest -> "kept it in the family" (Mostly changes in descriptions and texts. ie.: "has had incestuous relations" changes to "has kept it in the family")
* University -> Center for kids who can't read good
* Election -> Eating contest (also changes vote to feed, and candidates to contestants)

### OnlyHolyWarMusic
The soundtrack that plays when you declare a holy war is epic. Regular war sound is meh...\
Now all wars decelerations are epic.
